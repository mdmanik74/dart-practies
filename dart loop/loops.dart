/* Dart Loops
Dart Loop is used to run a block of code repetitively for a given number of times or until matches the specified condition. Loops are essential tools for any programming language. It is used to iterate the Dart iterable such as list, map, etc. and perform operations for multiple times. A loop can have two parts - a body of the loop and control statements. The main objective of the loop is to run the code multiple times. Dart supports the following type of loops.

Dart for loop
Dart forâ€¦in loop
Dart while loop
Dart do-while loop */

void main()  
{  
    int num = 1;  
    for(num; num<=10; num++)           //for loop to print 1-10 numbers  
    {  
        print(num);     //to print the number  
    }  
}
