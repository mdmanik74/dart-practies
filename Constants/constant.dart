//Dart Constants
/* Dart Constant is defined as an immutable object, which means it can't be changed or modified during the execution of the program. Once we initialize the value to the constant variable, it cannot be reassigned later. 
*/

//The Dart constant can be defined in the following two ways.

//Using the final keyword
// Using the const keyword

void main() {
  final a=10;
  final b=20;
  print(a);
